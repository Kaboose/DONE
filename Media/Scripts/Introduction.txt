The long standing Order of the Ninjas has a new apprentice, Den.
Though young, he shows great 
promise but, like all those before him, 
he must prove himself before he is accepted into their folds.
To 
enter into The Order, he has been tasked with recharging four 
elemental totems and bringing them back 
as proof of his conquest. 
While it is usually a task reserved for more seasoned ninjas, 
the overseers see 
great promise in him. Accompanied by a lone sage 
who can offer nothing more than advice, Den 
ventures out to travel 
across the domains and collect the energies of the four elements...
